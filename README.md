# CSGDiscordBot - Archived
Welcome to the archives of the CortSiriGoogle Discord Bot!

The archived files includes two versions, which is v1.x (named VersionOne, highly unstable and likely to have errors) and v2.x (named Version2. Rewritten, but only using one Python file script to operate, no cogs). All developed and was hosted by [@probablycort](https://github.com/probablycort/), no one else. If you would like to try out one of these versions, don't forget to install their requirements and make a virtual enviroment!

However, the [new version](https://github.com/probablycort/CSGDiscordBot) (v3.x) is now released to the public! It is also currently being hosted by [@probablycort](https://github.com/probablycort/) and rewritten by [@searinminecraft](https://github.com/searinminecraft/) on GitHub. This new rewritten version includes new cogs, so every command has been categorized properly and does not “looked like a horrible mess”. :3
